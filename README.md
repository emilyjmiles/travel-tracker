## About The Project
Travel Tracker is a travel tracking application. This application shows a user their past, upcoming, and pending travel plans based on their login information. When a user logs in, they are brought to their dashboard which displays a card for each trip with that trips details. A user will also see their cost breakdown for what they have spent for the current year to date. If a user would like to book a new trip, a form is available for them to submit a new trip request. Once that request is submited, the new trip will show up in their "Pending Trips" section while it waits for approval.

## Project Spec
Travel Tracker is an application built during my time at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) front-end engineering program. The goals of this [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html) were to:

* Create a robust testing suite using TDD
* Utilize Lighthouse and WAVE for accessibility
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Implement error handling 
* Implement third party packages
